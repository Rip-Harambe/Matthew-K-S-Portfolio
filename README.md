# Matthew-K-S-Portfolio
Grade 11 DMA Portfolio

Throughout this unit I have been working on learning Java and completeing a couple projects to become more familar with the language.

I used Codeacademy to learn Java because I found that the interaction of you actually coding everything you learn very useful.

Below are some examples of what I learned/did in Codeacademy.

My second project was a number guessing game.

You choose the range of numbers and how many guesses you want.

Everytime you guess it tells you if the answer is higher or lower.

Code for the number guessing game:
