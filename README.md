# Matthew-K-S-Portfolio
Grade 11 DMA Portfolio

Throughout this unit I have been working on learning Java and completeing a couple projects to become more familar with the language.
I used Codeacademy to learn Java because I found that the interaction of you actually coding everything you learn very useful.
Below are some examples of what I learned/did in Codeacademy.

The first project that I worked on was my simple bank program. In it I worked on making:
